# NovaStack
 *"Your mission control for teams and systems."*
 
 NovaStack is a customizable operations and productivity platform that puts every team in control of their own mission dashboard. Instead of being locked into rigid tools, users build the workspace with the tools that best increase their operational capacity using custom dashboards, components, and system names to match their actual workflows.
 
At the system level, NovaStack lets teams define and monitor OPSCAPs for each system, while automatically rolling them up into higher-level SYSCAPs for leadership visibility and reporting.
At the user level, NovaStack keeps accountability sharp with task assignments, deadlines, and status tracking, enhanced with stoplight charts and real-time logs of events, alerts, and alarms.

With NovaStack, every team â€” from frontline operators to HQ â€” sees exactly what matters most, in a system that feels like it was built just for them.
NovaStack isnâ€™t just another tool â€” itâ€™s your teamâ€™s mission dashboard.
